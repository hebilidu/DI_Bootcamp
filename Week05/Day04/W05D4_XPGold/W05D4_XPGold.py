print('\nXP Gold - Exercise 3 : Giphy API #2\n=================')
'''
Hint: For this exercise, check the documentation for this API

    Create a small Python program which asks the user for a category and returns all the gifs that belog to the category.
        If the category doesn’t exist or if the user didn’t enter a correct category, return the trending gifs of the day and a message stating that you couldn’t find the requested category.
        Note from the documentation : GIPHY Trending returns a list of the most relevant and engaging content each and every day.
